## About

Ember.js app with the following features:

- users can add questions, answer questions, and comment on answers
- users can click on a question to view its answers
- users can click on an answer to view its comments
- users can upvote questions, answers and comments

Note: I was able to display questions and answers sorted by number of upvotes, but could not
find a good way to sort comments. Also, something is broken in the template for displaying all the answers.

## Usage

Run `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and visit localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Bug reports
